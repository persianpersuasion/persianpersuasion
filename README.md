- 🌱 I’m currently working for the San Diego County Board of Supervisors, where I lead operations for an outreach department
- 💞️ I’m an undergrad at UC San Diego studying economics & dse, but have taken significant courseload in the ECE department. My favorite concentration is econometrics (big surprise)
